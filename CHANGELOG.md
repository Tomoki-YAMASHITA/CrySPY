# CHANGELOG
## [1.4.0] - 2025-6-17
### Important change
### New algorithm: EA-vc
- Currently, only the ASE interface is supported. Support for VASP and others is planned.

### Interactive mode
- RS, EA, and EA-vc can be run from the Jupyter environment.
- Only the ASE interface is supported.

### EA
- `tot_struc` is no longer used in EA. The number of structures in the first generation is now determined by `n_pop`.

### Interatomic distance check after structrue optimization
- Added `check_mindist_opt` to the [option] section in `cryspy.in`.
- Default: `check_mindist_opt = True`.
- After structure relaxation, a check is performed to ensure that the minimum interatomic distance constraint is satisfied.

### Common
- The `natot` parameter in `cryspy.in` has been removed.
- Ctrl_ext has been removed.

## Fixed
- Fixed a bug related to using `TS` as the `score` in BO.
- Several other minor fixes.

## [1.3.0] - 2024-5-31
### Important change
#### Common
- working directory name  
  work000000 --> work0
- We used to pickle data by grouping several data into tuples, but we changed it to pickle each item individually.  
  For example, rs_id_data.pkl --> id_queueing.pkl and id_running.pkl
#### BO
- Using cal_fingerprint program is obsolete. [dscribe](https://singroup.github.io/dscribe/latest) is required instead.
  + `fppath` and `fp_rmin` in cryspy.in are obsolete.
- Changed the Bayesian optimization library from COMBO to [PHYSBO](https://www.pasums.issp.u-tokyo.ac.jp/physbo/en/about)
### Fixed
#### soiap
- support for recent pymatgen
### Added
- Random structure generation and structure generation by EA are now available as libraries.
### for developer
- We stopped using global variables (rin), now uses dataclass for input data.
- Many of the input variables were lists, but we changed them to tuples.
